# nrepl-graalvm-sample

Sample project that tests [nrepl/nrepl](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl) usage with a native image compiled with GraalVM.

## Usage

1. Build a local jar of [this PR](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/pull/258) as it contains the necessary fixes for graalvm compilation.

2. Run the script to generate the jar and then compile with graalvm.

```bash
bash ./graalvm/native-unix-compile.sh
```

3. If everything goes well, it should generate a `nrepl-graalvm-sample` executable on the root of this project where you can run and see:
